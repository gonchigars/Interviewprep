In terms of compute services, I'm proficient with EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). I've set up and managed virtual servers for various applications, implemented auto-scaling groups, and configured load balancers to ensure high availability and optimal performance. This experience has given me a deep understanding of how to architect scalable and resilient cloud applications.
I've also worked extensively with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which has been invaluable for streamlining application deployment and management. Elastic Beanstalk has allowed me to focus more on application development while AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and application health monitoring.
Another area of expertise is serverless computing with AWS Lambda. I've developed and deployed serverless applications, integrating Lambda with other AWS services to create efficient, event-driven architectures. This has been particularly useful for building highly scalable and cost-effective solutions that can handle varying workloads.
In terms of container orchestration, I have experience with Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). I've deployed and managed complex, multi-container applications using Kubernetes on AWS, which has given me insights into modern microservices architectures and how to effectively orchestrate containerized applications at scale.
I've also implemented various deployment and scaling strategies. This includes setting up CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and using CloudFormation for infrastructure as code. These practices have allowed me to ensure consistent, repeatable deployments and efficiently manage infrastructure at scale.
Throughout my AWS journey, I've maintained a strong focus on performance optimization and cost management. I've used services like CloudFront for content delivery and API acceleration, and Cost Explorer for financial optimization and forecasting.
