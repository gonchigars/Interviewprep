1. Q: What is React?
   A: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

2. Q: What are the key features of React?
   A: Key features include virtual DOM, component-based architecture, unidirectional data flow, and JSX.

3. Q: What is JSX?
   A: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

4. Q: What is the virtual DOM?
   A: The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize rendering performance.

5. Q: How does React Router work?
   A: React Router allows for dynamic, client-side routing in a React application, enabling navigation without page reloads.

6. Q: What is the purpose of the 'key' prop when rendering a list of elements?
   A: The 'key' prop helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list.

7. Q: What are React Hooks?
   A: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

8. Q: What is the useState hook used for?
   A: useState is used to add state management to functional components.

9. Q: How does the useEffect hook work?
   A: useEffect is used for side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation.

10. Q: What is Redux and why might you use it?
    A: Redux is a state management library often used with React for managing complex application state.

11. Q: How do you implement code-splitting in React?
    A: Code-splitting can be implemented using React.lazy and Suspense for dynamically importing components.

12. Q: What is the purpose of the useMemo hook?
    A: useMemo is used to memoize expensive computations to optimize performance.

13. Q: How does the useCallback hook differ from useMemo?
    A: useCallback memoizes functions, while useMemo memoizes values.

14. Q: What is the Context API in React?
    A: The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props.

15. Q: How do you handle forms in React?
    A: Forms in React can be handled using controlled components where form data is stored in component state.

16. Q: What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?
    A: HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior.

17. Q: How do you optimize performance in a React application?
    A: Performance can be optimized through techniques like memoization, code-splitting, and using the React Profiler.

18. Q: What is the purpose of the useRef hook?
    A: useRef is used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders without causing re-renders.

19. Q: How do you handle side effects in React components?
    A: Side effects are typically handled using the useEffect hook in functional components.

20. Q: What is the difference between state and props?
    A: State is mutable and managed within a component, while props are immutable and passed from parent to child.

21. Q: How do you pass data from a child component to a parent component?
    A: Data can be passed from child to parent by passing a callback function as a prop to the child component.

22. Q: What is the purpose of the useContext hook?
    A: useContext allows functional components to consume values from a React context.

23. Q: How do you implement error boundaries in React?
    A: Error boundaries are implemented using class components with the componentDidCatch lifecycle method.

24. Q: What is the significance of the 'key' prop in reconciliation?
    A: The 'key' prop helps React efficiently update lists by identifying which items have changed.

25. Q: How do you conditionally render components in React?
    A: Conditional rendering can be done using ternary operators, && operator, or if statements in JSX.

26. Q: What is the purpose of React.Fragment?
    A: React.Fragment allows you to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.

27. Q: How do you handle asynchronous operations in React?
    A: Asynchronous operations can be handled using useEffect hook, async/await, or libraries like Redux-Thunk.

28. Q: What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
    A: Controlled components have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components manage their own state.

29. Q: How do you implement a custom hook?
    A: Custom hooks are created by extracting component logic into reusable functions that may use other hooks.

30. Q: What is the purpose of the useLayoutEffect hook?
    A: useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

31. Q: How do you implement server-side rendering with React?
    A: Server-side rendering can be implemented using frameworks like Next.js or by manually rendering React components on the server.

32. Q: What is the purpose of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute?
    A: dangerouslySetInnerHTML is used to inject HTML directly into a component, but should be used cautiously due to XSS risks.

33. Q: How do you handle routing in a React application?
    A: Routing is typically handled using libraries like React Router.

34. Q: What is the purpose of the useReducer hook?
    A: useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic.

35. Q: How do you implement debouncing in React?
    A: Debouncing can be implemented using custom hooks or libraries like lodash.

36. Q: What is the purpose of the React.memo function?
    A: React.memo is used to memoize functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

37. Q: How do you handle authentication in a React application?
    A: Authentication can be handled using JWT tokens, protected routes, and storing auth state in global state management.

38. Q: What is the purpose of the useImperativeHandle hook?
    A: useImperativeHandle customizes the instance value exposed when using ref on a child component.

39. Q: How do you implement infinite scrolling in React?
    A: Infinite scrolling can be implemented using intersection observers or libraries like react-infinite-scroll-component.

40. Q: What is the purpose of the StrictMode component in React?
    A: StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application, like deprecated lifecycle methods.

41. Q: How do you handle global state without using Redux?
    A: Global state can be managed using the Context API or other state management libraries like Recoil or MobX.

42. Q: What is the purpose of the useTransition hook in React 18?
    A: useTransition allows you to mark some state updates as non-urgent, improving perceived performance.

43. Q: How do you implement code-splitting on a route level?
    A: Route-level code-splitting can be implemented using React.lazy with React Router.

44. Q: What is the purpose of the useDeferredValue hook?
    A: useDeferredValue lets you defer updating a part of the UI, similar to debouncing.

45. Q: How do you handle form validation in React?
    A: Form validation can be handled using libraries like Formik or react-hook-form, or by implementing custom validation logic.

46. Q: What is the purpose of the React Developer Tools?
    A: React Developer Tools is a browser extension that helps inspect React component hierarchies and state.

47. Q: How do you implement a modal in React?
    A: Modals can be implemented using portals to render content outside the normal component tree.

48. Q: What is the purpose of the useId hook in React 18?
    A: useId generates unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.

49. Q: How do you handle internationalization in a React application?
    A: Internationalization can be implemented using libraries like react-intl or i18next.

50. Q: What are the main differences between React and other frontend frameworks like Angular or Vue?
    A: React is a library focused on UI components, while Angular and Vue are more comprehensive frameworks. React uses a virtual DOM and JSX, while the others have different templating systems and update mechanisms.
