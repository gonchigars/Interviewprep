Title: BlogApp - A Scalable, Containerized Blog Platform

Introduction (30 seconds):
BlogApp is a robust, scalable blog platform built with Java and Spring Boot. It's designed to provide a powerful API for blog post management, user operations, and content moderation. This system is engineered to handle high traffic and is containerized for easy deployment and scaling on Amazon EKS.

Key Features (1 minute):
1. RESTful API:
   - Developed comprehensive REST endpoints using Spring Web for post management and user operations.
   - Implemented CRUD operations for blog posts and users.

2. Content Moderation:
   - Integrated an approval system for blog posts to ensure content quality.
   - Implemented an endpoint for post approval, allowing for content moderation.

3. Data Persistence:
   - Utilized Spring Data JPA for efficient database operations.
   - Implemented entity relationships, such as the Many-to-One relationship between Posts and Users.

4. Service Layer Architecture:
   - Developed separate service classes (PostService, UserService) to encapsulate business logic.
   - Implemented dependency injection for loose coupling between components.

Technical Highlights (1 minute):
1. Spring Boot Framework:
   - Leveraged Spring Boot for rapid application development and auto-configuration.
   - Utilized Spring Boot's embedded server for easy deployment.

2. JPA and Hibernate:
   - Used JPA annotations for object-relational mapping.
   - Leveraged Hibernate as the JPA provider for database operations.

3. RESTful API Design:
   - Implemented RESTful principles in API design.
   - Used Spring's @RestController for handling HTTP requests.

4. Containerization and Orchestration:
   - Containerized the application using Docker for consistency across environments.
   - Deployed on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for orchestration and scaling.

Challenges and Solutions (1 minute):
1. Challenge: Ensuring data integrity in a distributed system.
   Solution: Implemented transactional methods in service layer to maintain data consistency.

2. Challenge: Optimizing for scalability.
   Solution: Utilized stateless design principles and leveraged EKS for horizontal scaling.

3. Challenge: Managing complex relationships between entities.
   Solution: Carefully designed JPA entities with appropriate fetch types and cascading operations.

4. Challenge: Streamlining deployment process.
   Solution: Created a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI, automating the build, test, and deploy process to EKS.
